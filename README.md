-Simple Camping

If you've got camping installed, why not run all these examples using TheCampingServer?

From this directory, run: `camping .`

- Notes
* Ruby version 2.0.0 is required, 2.1.0 in my examples would not run due to a
 the newer active record (4.1.1) gem messing up the SchemaInfo.find(:first) call.
* You'll need the active_record and acts_as_versioned gems installed.
* The Gemfile contains all that's needed to run the example
